            <p>
              I’ve been told I’m a bit of a <span class="emphasis">“renaissance woman”</span> and software development
              is my latest endeavor. After moving
              to Seattle WA in January 2020, I decided it was time to to start my new life fresh with an equally new
              career.
              I’m grateful to have the means to pursue this opportunity as my small-town, Florida-girl legs get used to
              all of
              the city’s hills and I try to wrap my head around not needing air conditioning in my apartment.

              As fulfilling as my work in toxicology was, ever since I finished my degree in chemistry
              there was a nagging sense that this was not where I belonged. I only began my pursuit of chemistry because
              a few friends
              were taking advanced classes in high school and I wasn’t sure what to pick. My path forward felt like an
              obligation.
              I was tethered to a choice I made at sixteen. Ever since I've been afraid to branch out, explore the
              unknown, and change. After a point I felt trapped. <span class="emphasis">Was it too late to turn around
                and start over?</span>

              My breaking point was not getting the forensic toxicology job that I had lined up before moving to
              Seattle. There were not many other options and the weight of my failure was honestly nothing short of
              devastating. But, it also meant I was free.
              Free to finally run down a new path and move towards a new goal. One that felt more my own. The
              flexibility, the job
              opportunities, the diverse career possibilities. With a few tools at my disposal, a few languages under my
              belt, and an unyielding passion
              for problem-solving I am able to do anything. <span class="emphasis">I can be anyone</span>.

            <h4>Pilates</h4>
            <p>I've been adhering to the Blogilates program on YouTube for almost five years now.</p>
            <p>As a pretty inactive, awkward kid I never found exercises that appealed to me. Staying inside to read or
              play video games, and more importantly- escape the Florida heat, was always more appealing. I'm glad that
              I discovered something as an adult to keep me healthy, mentally and emotionally. It even meets the old
              indoors requirement!</p>

            <p>I caught the travel bug from my partner Nick. His love of the outdoors and my passion for costuming has
              lead to some pretty interesting experiences! If you couldn't tell, I'm usually the one in the wig.</p>
