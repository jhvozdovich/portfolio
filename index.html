              A recreation of the Wikipedia Homepage used to practice Bootstrap grid styling. 
              The use of nesting to recreate the intended layout was achieved, but more styling is needed.

              A page dedicated to one of my pair partner's favorite video games - <em>Counter-Strike</em>. 
              Styling was done in CSS before the introduction of Bootstrap, using the box model, media queries, and floats.

              This website shows the use of HTML div elements whose classes allow for styling with CSS. 
              The exercise specifically targeted cascading, inheritance, and specificity.

              A website created for my cat, Zora. It is an early attempt at linking a CSS stylesheet to an HTML file and 
              experiments with the different properties available for customization.

              served as an early exercise in using Git commits and pushing code to GitHub.

            The current version of this website was made before I began classes at Epicodus. I look forward 
            to incorporating what I now know about Bootstrap into the styling. It was a struggle to position basic 
            elements without knowledge of its simplified grid system.

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I’ve been told I’m a bit of a “renaissance woman” and software development is my latest endeavor. After moving 
        to Seattle WA in January 2020, I decided it was time to to start my new life fresh with an equally new career. 
        I’m grateful to have the means to pursue this opportunity as my small town, Florida-girl legs get used to all of 
        the city’s hills and I try to wrap my head around the idea of not needing air conditioning in my apartment.
