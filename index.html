              <p>
                I’ve been told I’m a bit of a <span class="emphasis">“renaissance woman”</span> and software development is my latest endeavor. After moving 
                to Seattle WA in January 2020, I decided it was time to to start my new life fresh with an equally new career. 
                I’m grateful to have the means to pursue this opportunity as my small-town, Florida-girl legs get used to all of 
                the city’s hills and I try to wrap my head around not needing air conditioning in my apartment.

                    The current version of this website was made before I began classes at Epicodus. I look forward 
                    to incorporating what I now know about Bootstrap into the styling. It was a struggle to position basic 
                    elements without knowledge of its grid system.

                As fulfilling as my work in toxicology was, ever since I finished my degree in chemistry 
                there was a nagging sense that this was not where I belonged. I only began my pursuit of chemistry because a few friends 
                were taking advanced classes in high school and I wasn’t sure what to pick. My path forward felt like an obligation. 
                I was tethered to a choice I made at sixteen. Ever since I've been afraid to branch out, explore the unknown, and change. After a point I felt trapped. <span class="emphasis">Was it too late to turn around 
                and start over?</span>

                My breaking point was not getting the forensic toxicology job that I had lined up before moving to 
                Seattle. There were not many other options and the weight of my failure was honestly nothing short of devastating. But, it also meant I was free. 
                Free to finally run down a new path and move towards a new goal. One that felt more my own. The flexibility, the job 
                opportunities, the diverse career possibilities. With a few tools at my disposal, a few languages under my belt, and an unyielding passion 
                for problem-solving I am able to do anything. <span class="emphasis">I can be anyone</span>.

              <p>As a pretty inactive, awkward kid I never found exercises that appealed to me. Staying inside to read or play video games, and more importantly- escape the Florida heat, was always more appealing. I'm glad that I discovered something as an adult to keep me healthy, mentally and emotionally. It even meets the old indoors requirement!</p>
