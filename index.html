              A recreation of the Wikipedia Homepage used to practice Bootstrap grid styling. 
              The use of nesting to recreate the intended layout was achieved, but more styling is needed.

              A page dedicated to one of my pair partner's favorite video games - <em>Counter-Strike</em>. 
              Styling was done in CSS before the introduction of Bootstrap, using the box model, media queries, and floats.

              This website shows the use of HTML div elements whose classes allow for styling with CSS. 
              The exercise specifically targeted cascading, inheritance, and specificity.

            The current version of this website was made before I began classes at Epicodus. I look forward 
            to incorporating what I now know about Bootstrap into the styling. It was a struggle to position basic 
            elements without knowledge of its simplified grid system.

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I’ve been told I’m a bit of a <span class="emphasis">“renaissance woman”</span> and software development is my latest endeavor. After moving 
        to Seattle WA in January 2020, I decided it was time to to start my new life fresh with an equally new career. 
        I’m grateful to have the means to pursue this opportunity as my small town, Florida-girl legs get used to all of 
        the city’s hills and I try to wrap my head around the idea of not needing air conditioning in my apartment.
      </p>

        <img src="./img/lab-background.jpg" alt="Photo from a polymer chemistry lab." class="picture small">
        As much as I learned and was fulfilled by my work in forensic toxicology, since I finished my degree in chemistry 
        there was a nagging sense that it wasn’t where I belonged. I only began my pursuit of chemistry because a few friends 
        were taking advanced classes in high school and I wasn’t sure what to pick. My path forward felt like an obligation. 
        I was afraid to branch out, explore the unknown, and change. After a point I felt trapped. <span class="emphasis">Was it too late to turn around 
        and start over</span>?
      </p>
      <p>
        My breaking point was not getting the forensic toxicology job that I thought I had lined up before I made the move to 
        Seattle. There weren’t many other options and the weight of my failure was rather devastating. But, it also meant I was free. 
        Free to finally run down a new path and move towards a new goal. One that felt more my own. The flexibility, the job 
        opportunities, the diverse career possibilities. With a few tools at my disposal, a few languages under my belt, and a passion 
        for problem solving I can do anything. <span class="emphasis">I can be anyone</span>.

      <h3>Hobbies</h3>
      <h4><em>Cosplay</em></h4>
      <img src="./img/phos-cosplay.jpg" class="picture" alt="Cosplay of Phosphophyllite from the anime Houseki No Kuni (Land of the Lustrous).">
      <p>I've been dressing up as fictional characters and attending conventions since the summer of 2009.</p>
      <p>The logic was <em>"Halloween all the time? Sign me up!"</em> And I haven't been able to stop since!</p>
      <p>Wig Styling - Sewing - SFX Makeup - Prop Making - Modeling - Photography</p>

      <h4><em>Pilates</em></h4>
      <p>I've been following the Blogilates program on YouTube for almost five years.</p>
      <p>As a pretty inactive, awkward kid I never found exercises that appealed to me. I'm glad that I found something as an adult to keep me healthy, mentally and emotionally.</p>
      <h4><em>Travel</em></h4>
      <p>I caught the travel blog from my partner Nick. His love of the outdoors and my passion for costuming has lead to some pretty interesting experiences!</p>
